imagine making userscripts

1. install python
2. install poetry
3. poetry install
4. poetry run python mass_uploader.py

_Should_ work exactly the same as the old userscript, except it's made with a meme UI lib I learned in 10 minutes and it's janky as fuck because I wanna go to sleep. Also you have to use the new manga/group UUIDs which is extra cancer. Good luck.
