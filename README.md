# Mangadex Mass Uploader: Not A Userscript Edition

## Description
This is a GUI tool to aid those who wish to farm 500 chapter uploads on [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org),
but are not autistic enough to use the command line tools that other people have made.
This will allow you to obtain the legendary `Power Uploader` role,
granting greater editing privileges on the website,
access to secret channels on the Discord server
where you can make connections with upper members of the scanlation cabal,
and the ability to flex on standard users.
This script is only tested on Windows.

## Installation
### Windows
1. Download and run the .exe from the releases page.
### Linux
1. Install python 3.9.
2. Install poetry.
3. I assume the average linux user knows how to clone this repo.
4. `poetry install` in the repo folder.
5. `poetry run python mass_uploader.py`
###  Mac OS
1. Follow the linux instructions and pray for the best.
