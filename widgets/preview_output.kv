            Insert chapter names, volume numbers, chapter numbers, and group IDs into their respective fields. Each line is one chapter.
            Inputting a single value will use that for all chapters. For chapter number, it'll increment by 1 for each chapter instead.
            If you want a chapter to have an empty title or whatever, just skip a line.
            A preview of the chapters will appear in this panel once files are selected.
            The log panel at the bottom will tell you if you fucked up.
            If there are any bugs or you want any features just make a PR so that I don't actually have to do more work.
